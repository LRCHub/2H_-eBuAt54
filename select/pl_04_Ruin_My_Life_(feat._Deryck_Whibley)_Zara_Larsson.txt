I used to lie awake
and let you occupy my mind
I used to put you first
and always leave myself behind
And I'll admit
you got real close
but I'll be sleeping fine
tonight
Sorry,
I don't mean to disappoint you
It didn't ruin my life
Why'd I let you in my head
I never shoulda let you creep in
Every single word you said
Gotta find a way to shake it
You don't wanna let me be
You wanna see my fall to pieces
Tryna put a curse on me
Gotta find a way to break it
I used to lie awake
and let you occupy my mind
I used to put you first
and always leave myself behind
And I'll admit
you got real close
but I'll be sleeping fine
tonight
Sorry,
I don't mean to disappoint you
It didn't ruin my life
Some days I just can't win
You always had to point
your finger
But words will never pierce
my skin
I finally found a way
to shake them
And you can spill your hate
on me
Now I know that I can take it
And you're the one
who's hurt clearly
You're the one
who's really breaking
I used to lie awake
and let you occupy my mind
I used to put you first
and always leave myself behind
And I'll admit
you got real close
but I'll be sleeping fine
tonight
Sorry,
I don't mean to disappoint you
It didn't ruin my life
I used to lie awake
and let you occupy my mind
(occupy my mind)
I used to put you first
and always leave myself behind
And I'll admit
you got real close
but I'll be sleeping fine
tonight
Sorry,
I don't mean to disappoint you
You didn't ruin my life
You didn't ruin my life
You didn't ruin my life
