You buy me a drink
I know you checking me out
Why don't you taking me out
You get my number
In a club of amber
You gave me a call
But never answer my ring
Such a selfish king
I need your pardon
Invite me to your garden
Whatever it takes
I need your touch
Looking in my mirror
I feelin miserable
Rule my world
My majesty
Beause my life is in your hand
Ruined my life
This is the best thing I
ever had
Don't dream about the future
I can be your one night stand
Ohh
Want you to ruin my life
Baby don't wanna lose you
